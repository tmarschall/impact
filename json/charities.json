The Against Malaria Foundation and Dr. Christen Lengeler of the Swiss Tropical Institute estimate that one life is saved for every 160 bednet years, or every 20 bednets purchased (~$60).  Charity research organization GiveWell has made the much more conservative estimate that $3400 must be donated to the Against Malaria Foundation before a donor can be sure that a life has been saved by the donation.  Public donations are used exclusively to fund bednets, so the Against Malaria Foundation has an effective overhead rate of 0% (non-net costs are fundraised for separately, and discussed here).",

For this reason, PSI's DALY averted measurements vary largely depending on the programs operating in each country.  PSI's cost per DALY is based on in-country costs and a share of PSI’s costs at headquarters.  To arrive at a net cost per DALY, PSI offsets costs with sales revenue (e.g. revenue brought in from the sale of condoms and other commodities).  PSI’s overhead is 6.56%, made up of 6.5% management costs and 0.06% fundraising costs, which are already factored into PSI’s $17.77 cost per year of healthy life.

They can increase the morbidity and mortality of malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, and infected children are often too sick to attend school.

      "organization": "The developing world accounts for 90% of global cases of blindness and vision impairment, where almost everyone with a cataract becomes blind and more than half of blind children will die within a few years of losing sight. Yet 80% of all visual impairments could be avoided or cured. To help bridge this gap, Seva builds sustainable eye care programs in many of the world’s most impoverished communities.",
      "numbers": "Seva’s revolutionary designs mean that as little as $50 can fund a cataract surgery. Your donation may also help provide eyeglasses, training for surgeons and health care workers, and facilities and equipment—each a great combination of cost-effectiveness and powerful impact. Seva has received funding by passing the systematic screening methods applied by Focusing Philanthropy. In 1978, $5,000 of their first funding came from the not-yet-famous computer inventor Steve Jobs. Over 35 years, Seva has helped 3.5 million people in 20 countries see again; in 2012-13 alone, they provided eye care services to one million people. Seva’s overhead costs for FY1314 were 13.1%, and are included in their cost-per-impact calculations.",
      "recommendation": "The World Bank has identified cataract surgery as one of the most cost-effective of all public health interventions. In 2007, The Council on Foundations presented Seva with the prestigious Critical Impact Award for \"revolutionizing\" community-based eye care."
